These are the Results of analyzing the Breastcancer-Dataset with the following random Forest:

RandomForestClassifier(bootstrap=True, class_weight=None, criterion='gini',
            max_depth=3, max_features='auto', max_leaf_nodes=None,
            min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None,
            min_samples_leaf=3, min_samples_split=2,
            min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, n_estimators=10, n_jobs=1,
            oob_score=False, random_state=None, verbose=0,
            warm_start=False)

The following measurements were taken:
